# Dumpling's Delight Rewrapped
A port of [Dumpling's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/dumplings-delight) by [FoggyHillSide](https://modrinth.com/user/FoggyHillside) 
<br><br>
Other than bringing the mod to a newer Minecraft version, changes include:
- toned down wonton food value
- rabbit meat dumpling now takes either rabbit meat or foot instead of both
- crops and dumplings now compostable
- using neoforge tags (or at least in the way [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) does)
- [Serene Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/serene-seasons) support
- some advancement adjustments
